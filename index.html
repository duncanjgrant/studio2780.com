        <h1>2780&mdash;Katoomba's coworking space</h1>
        <p>
          We’re a small group of smart creative types who are setting up a shared office as a co-working space in Katoomba.
          We’re looking  for people to join us in this innovative venture we’ve called 2780&mdash;Katoomba’s co-working space.

        <h2>What is co-working?</h2>
        <p>
          Co-working is an international movement that provides a model for establishing and managing creative work spaces.
          It is a member based culture for creative professionals that brings individuals together to work in a shared space.
          The space is arranged so that people can work by themselves and is also designed to enable collaborations between our
          members.  Whether you’re a work-at-home professional, or an independent contractor, if you have struck out on your own
          and are missing out on the good bits of working in creative company, the conversations, inspiration, or collaborations,
          then co-working might just be right for you.  2780 works to provide its members with all of the benefits of working
          for a creative company with the advantages of working independently.
        </p>

        <h2>Who’s behind all this?</h2>
        <p>
          Currently there are four of us - a software developer, a permaculture designer, a writer and a graphic designer.
          We’re all Katoomba based people who want to create a vibrant workspace where we’ll love working.  We’re looking for
          a few more like minded people to join us.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h2>What’s this to do with me?</h2>
        <p>
          We’re looking for creative types who do quiet desk based work (or similar) to join us.  We see ‘creative’ as a
          broad canvas - from lawyers to animators, from writers to designers - people who are working creating things.
        </p> 

        <h2>What will it cost?</h2>
        <p>
          We are aiming to have a weekly rent of under $100.  And an annual membership fee of $250. This is a social
          enterprise, meaning it is for purpose rather than for profit, so there’s no faceless company making a mint
          from the rent.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h2>How long will I need to sign up for?</h2>
        <p>
          Initially we’re offering a six month contract beginning mid-August.  If the timing doesn’t quite suit you,
          call us and we’ll see if we can work something out.
        </p>

        <h2>What will I get for my money?</h2>
        <p>
          You get to come and work each day in a beautiful light filled creative space located in an iconic heritage
          building in Katoomba.  The space is the tiniest sliver short of 200 square meters.  A large expanse of this
          great space will be be kept open plan, housing individually focused work areas as well as spaces for
          collaboration.  Included in your weekly rent are power and wireless broadband.  There is an ample eat-in
          kitchen for lunches and conviviality and two bathrooms.  The office is an easy walk from the station, however,
          if you really want to drive there are parking spaces on site.

        <h2>Where is the 2780 office?</h2>
        <p>
          The 2780 office will be located upstairs in the old post office building at the top of (59-61) Katoomba St.
        </p>

        <h2>Can I join part-time?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, the part-time rent will be $25 for each day per week.  The membership fee is $250 annually and we’d
          still be looking for a 6 month commitment.
        </p>
    
        <h2>What advantage do I have for joining now?</h2>
        <p>
          Founding members will have the chance to contribute to the design of the space and will also get to have
          a say in how 2780 is organised.  And you’ll be helping create a new and exciting venture.
        </p>

        <h2>Why 2780?</h2>
        <p>
          We’re delighted to live and work in Katoomba, so this is our little celebration of the number that defines
          our region.  Plus it’s a nice synergy as we’re in the old area post office.  Hurrah for 2780!
