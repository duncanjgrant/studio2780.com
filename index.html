        <h2>Where is 2780?</h2>

        <h2>What is co-working?</h2>
        <p>
          Co-working is an international movement that provides a model for establishing and managing creative work spaces.
          It is a member based culture for creative professionals that brings individuals together to work in a shared space.
          The space is arranged so that people can work by themselves and is also designed to enable collaborations between our
          members.  Whether you’re a work-at-home professional, or an independent contractor, if you have struck out on your own
          and are missing out on the good bits of working in creative company, the conversations, inspiration, or collaborations,
          then co-working might just be right for you.  2780 works to provide its members with all of the benefits of working
          for a creative company with the advantages of working independently.
        </p>
        <h2>Why 2780?</h2>
        <p>
          We’re delighted to live and work in Katoomba, so this is our little celebration of the number that defines
          our region.  Plus it’s a nice synergy as we’re in the old area post office.  Hurrah for 2780!
        </p>
        <h2>Who’s behind all this?</h2>
        <p>
          Currently there are four of us - a software developer, a permaculture designer, a writer and a graphic designer.
          We’re all Katoomba based people who want to create a vibrant workspace where we’ll love working.  We’re looking for
          a few more like minded people to join us.
        </p>

        <h2>It's not about the big bucks</h2>
        <p>
          This is a social
          enterprise, meaning it is for purpose rather than for profit, so there’s no faceless company making a mint
          from the rent.
        </p>
          <p>
          The annual membership fee shows us you're serious and the weekly rent covers the running cost of the space. 
        </p>
        <h2>Join now</h2>
        <p>
          This is your opportunity to contribute to the design of the space. By becoming a founder member of 2780
          you will also get to have a say in how 2780 is organised.  And you’ll be helping create a new and exciting venture.
